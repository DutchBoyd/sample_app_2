   - Playing around with git
   - Understanding branches, merging, push requests, checkouts, 
   - git branch (lists all branches)
   - git branch -d {branch name} (deletes the branch)
   - git add . (adds all files to current branch)
   - git commit -a -m "MESSAGE" (shortcut which combines git add and git commit)

    - Using the rspec test module and Capybara DSL

November 3, 2013

Finished Chapter 3
     - Learned about the application layout file
     - Learned about the yield() function in erb (embedded ruby) files
     - Learned the difference between (%= %) and (% %) tags (equals passes the argument to the html page, % just executes the ruby code)
	 - Skipped the advanced exercises having to do with eliminating the "bundle exec" typing requirement, using guard, allowing test runs in sublime
	 - Learned about the "let" command in the rspec tests, which allow you to set variables instead of repeating yoruself
